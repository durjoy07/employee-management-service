## Features
- Fetch employee data based on position hierarchy.
- Efficient caching to minimize database load.
- Scalable architecture to handle high concurrency.
- Error logging with Winston.
- Pre-commit checks with Husky.
- Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions.
- Implemented pull request template.

## Load Testing

### Introduction
To ensure that our service can handle a high number of requests, we use Artillery for load testing. This helps us simulate traffic and identify potential bottlenecks.

### Installing Artillery
Artillery is a powerful load testing toolkit which can be installed globally via npm:
```bash
npm install -g artillery (make sure you have install this globally)

Run load test:
```bash
artillery run load-test.yml
```

### Deploy on EC2
Go to your EC2 instance console, then follow below steps:

```bash
sudo su
sudo yum update -y
Sudo yum install -y docker
Sudo docker â€”version
sudo service docker start

sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user
sudo docker info
Sudo yum install git 
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your github mail" 
```

Docker build:
```bash
docker build -t employee-management-service:0.0.1 .
```

Docker run:
```bash
docker run -d -p 4000:4000 --name employee-management-service employee-management-service:0.0.1 
```

### API Endpoints

- **POST /auth/login**
  - Credentials {"username" : "user", "password": "user321"}
  - After successful login, you will get token

- **GET /employees/by-id/:id**
  - Fetch all employees with a position ID greater than the given employee's position ID, including hierarchical structure.

- **GET /employees/auth/by-id/:id** (This is a private route, You have to send bearer token)
  - Fetch all employees with a position ID greater than the given employee's position ID, including hierarchical structure.

- **POST /employee**
  - You can add an employee using this API

Sample payload for this post API
```bash
{
  "name": "string",
  "position_id": 0,
  "position_name": "string"
}
```
